# Graphs

A graph is composed by edges (côtés) and vertex (sommets).

There is two kinds of graph :  
 - Bipart graphs
 - Complete graphs.

## Bipart graphs

There are represented by ![Bipartgraphe](/uploads/bipartgraphe.png "Bipartgraphe"), and there is `x * y` edges.

## Complete Graphs

There are represented by: ![Graphcomplet](/uploads/graphcomplet.png "Graphcomplet"). And there is : ![Edgeofcompletegraph](/uploads/edgeofcompletegraph.png "Edgeofcompletegraph") edges.

### Handshake

Suppose we would to know how many handshake there will be if 5 persons are meeting. We only have to trace the complete graph and the edges will represent the handshakes.

## Degree of vertex

The degree of a vertex is given by the **number** of edge connected to it.

## Leonhard Euler

Leonhard Euler discovered that we can *draw* a graph with one **continuous stroke** while tracing every edge exactly once when the graph as no more than two vertex with an odd degree.

### The Bridges

He discovered this on studying the geographic of the Königsberg town. He found also that the odd vertex will always be the first and/or last vertex drawn.

If seven bridges belong to a town and there is more than two island with an odd number of bridge connected to it, so there is no way to walk around the city crossing all bridges only once. Additionally the two odd island must be the **first** and **last**...
